Ice Velocity calculator controls for IMCORR

This repository is just to archive code written and allow for reuse in future scripts.  Much of it is too specifically written to be generally useful.  That said, for users of IMCORR (http://nsidc.org/data/velmap/imcorr.html), embodied in these scripts is the knowledge of how to avoid using tie points to co-reference images, which is mighty convenient.
